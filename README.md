## Project: Todo app

### Author: Brady Davenport

### Problem Domain

#### Phase 1: Context settings (25 Jul 2022)

Incorporate configuration settings to the application. In this phase, we’ll be adding some top-level settings for the application, so that the user can make some display choices that the app will use by default.

##### Phase 1 Feature Tasks

- Style the application using the Blueprint Component API{target:_blank}
- Properly modularize the application into separate components
- Implement the Context API to make some basic application settings available to components
  - How many To Do Items to show at once
  - Whether or not to show completed items

#### Phase 2: Context API - Behaviors (26 Jul 2022)

Incorporate configuration settings to the application. In this phase, we’ll be adding an editor so that users can save their preferences for the application, allowing them to change some of the default behaviors

##### Phase 2 Feature Tasks

- Implement the Context API to make some basic application settings available to components
  - How many To Do Items to show at once
  - Whether or not to show completed items
- Provide the users with a form where they can change the values for those settings
  - This should be given in the form of a new component, perhaps linked to from the main navigation
  - Hint: Use Browser Router to create the page/route/component for this
- Save the users choices in Local Storage
- Retrieve their preferences from Local Storage and apply them to the application on startup
